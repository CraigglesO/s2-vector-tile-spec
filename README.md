# S2 Vector Tile Specification

A specification for encoding tiled vector data.

## Implementations

* [s2-vector-tile](https://github.com/Regia-Corporation/s2-vector-tile)

## Versioning

The specification is versioned based on `major.minor` notation. The `major` version will be incremented with any technical change to the specification format or way it should be interpreted. Changes to the `minor` version will be reserved for any clarification or correction of clerical errors associated with the specification language.

The `major` version in the specification name is synonymous with the `version` field in an S2 Vector Tile layer. See the `3.1. Layers` section for more details.
